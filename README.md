# React-Redux-App
Module Project: Async Redux - React Redux App
This project allows me to practice the concepts and techniques of asyncronous action creators in Redux. I am demonstrating proficiency of these subjects and principles by building an app from scratch that consumes pokemon API , and displays data fetched from this API.


# Minimum Viable Product
 Build a React Redux app
 Fetch data inside an async action creator from an API of your choosing
 Add the data from the API to the Redux store
 Display the data from the store in a component
 Some styling must be applied.
